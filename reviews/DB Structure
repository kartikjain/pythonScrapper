Reviews are embedded in Hotel documents in order to make it easy to search on hotels based on reviews and hotel parameters.

Since reviews would always be relevant with respect to a hotel only having them separate would not be productive.
Although this can make hotel documents heavy but search time increases .

Deployment:

The Flask Server and mongo db is hosted on Amazon EC2 Linux Instance
Flask is hosted with Uwsgi and Nginx Server.
Most of the scrapped documents are available at the given url although some might not be there due to server overload.
However ALL files have been scrapped and saved to the items.json and reviews.json file.
