2)Data exporter
3)Flask Api

Code for scrapy and Data exporter is here
https://github.com/kartikjain/pythonScrapper

Install the required modules from requirements.txt file or

pip install scrapy
pip install pymongo

Go to <>/pythonScrapper/hotelAdvisor
and type scrapy crawl hotel

This will start the data scraping process.
Please stay connected to the internet .

The data will start getting collected in reviews.json and items.json file.
In case you want to stop in between press Control+C just once . In a few seconds it will stop naturally .
If pressed twice it will force close and data will become corrupt.

Once Data is ready in these two files run the exporter file.

python export.py

Before Doing so please provide correct Mongodb credentials at the top of the file.
This process will start saving the data from the two files into Mongo db in a database called platform and collection called hotels.
