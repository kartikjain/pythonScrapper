Scraping starts from this url

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotels-g304555-oa600-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan-Hotels.html

The Name , Total reviews, rank and Rating is scrapped for each hotel.
Once this page is done the url from next button is picked up and next set of hotels are scrapped until there is no next.

Also On clicking each hotel the hotel profile page opens.
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g304555-d307723-Reviews-Alsisar_Haveli-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html

For every hotel we open this page and from there we open the first review page.

This page provides us information in an easier way.
For each review we scrap those things which are mandatory for users to fill i.e
Rating
Review
Traveller type - Friends/business/Couple/Solo
Travel_time - Month of travel

At the bottom we have next set of reviews followed by a hyperlinked Next button.
We navigate to the next button until there is no more reviews for the hotel.
